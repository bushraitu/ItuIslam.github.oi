  <h1 style="text-align: center;">EXPLORE  TOP RATED TOURIST ATTRACTIONS IN ALANYA</h1><br>
  <p style="font-size:25px">Alanya is best known for its beaches. The sandy strips in town itself, and strung along the surrounding coast, are all about laid-back resort vacations and are usually packed out by a clientele of northern Europeans from June through August.<br><br>There's more to Alanya than its shore though. The high cliff of the peninsula is home to an ancient castle district, all surrounded by well-preserved, sturdy stone walls.Down at the harbor, more historical remnants survive, looming over a bay where yachts sit ready to whisk you out onto the sea.Alanya is also within day-tripping distance of some of this Mediterranean region's most well-known ancient sites and tourist attractions, so if you want to brush off the sand for the day and head out to explore, there is plenty to keep you occupied off the beach.As well as the places mentioned on this list, you can easily also make day trips to Antalya to visit its museum and stroll its old town district, Aspendos (Turkey's most famous Roman Theater), and other major archaeological sites near Antalya such as Perge.For some ideas on how to plan your trip check out our list of the top places to visit and things to do in Alanya</p>
  <br>
  <h2>1. Explore Alanya Castle</h2><br>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2020/08/turkey-alanya-top-things-to-do-explore-alanya-castle.jpg">
    <p>Alanya Castle walls</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">Explore, and take in the panoramic views from, the hilltop home of Alanya's historic core.The six-kilometer stretch of ancient walls of Alanya Castle trail along the high promontory that shadows the modern sprawl of Alanya below. Inside the walls is Alanya's old town district, the most interesting area of the city to explore.Alanya Castle's history dates back to the Classical era, when this craggy, cave-riddled peninsula was a favorite haunt for pirates.The Greek-built fortifications were extended under Roman rule but it was during the Byzantine era that Alanya's role as a Mediterranean seaport began to take off.When the Seljuk's took control of this region in the 13th century, they built on the foundations of previous rulers. Much of the remaining building works still standing today in the castle area date from this period, when Alanya became a commercial hub.The lower castle area, nearest to the entrance gate, is known as the Ehmedek neighborhood. Wander the alleyways of red-roofed Ottoman-era houses and historical buildings here, then follow the winding lanes up to the Iç Kale (the castle's inner fortress) for older Seljuk and Byzantine ruins plus views that soar across the sea, the coastal plateau, and the peaks of the Taurus Mountains beyond.</p>

  <br>
  <h2>2. Delve into Alanya Harbor's History</h2><br>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2020/08/turkey-alanya-top-things-to-do-delve-into-alanya-harbors-history.jpg">
    <p>Red Tower</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">Stroll this ancient port's defensive walls from the Red Tower to the TersaneHarbor-side, both the Red Tower (Kızılkule) and Seljuk Shipyard (Tersane) are extensions of Alanya castle fortifications, built in the 13th century.The octagonal, 30-meter-high Red Tower served as the harbor's defense tower in the Seljuk era. Inside, there are exhibits on the Red Tower's and Alanya's history, but you're really here to climb up to the roof for great views across the harbor front.From the tower, a pretty walkway runs along the harbor's original fortification walls to Turkey's only remaining example of a Seljuk-era shipyard. The arched halls here, built into the shorefront, are open to the sea, so that waves constantly pummel the stone.The walkway continues from here for a short length along the coastline to a small Seljuk-era watchtower building.<br><b>Address: Rıhtım Caddesi, Çarsı, Alanya</b></p>

  <br>
  <h2>3. Ride Alanya Teleferik</h2><br>
  <div style="text-align: center;">

    <p>Teleferik heading to Cleopatra Beach</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">Views over the craggy cliffs meeting the sea below on this scenic trip to the castle. The most scenic way to reach the Alanya Castle area is by hopping on the Alanya Teleferik (cable car) that connects Cleopatra Beach with the lower castle district of Ehmedek. The cable car operates between 11am and 9pm daily, and the trip over the cliff is great for capturing sunset coastal views, as well as a means of transport.The 900-meter ride offers excellent views over the forested cliff face leading up to the castle, the yawning strip of Cleopatra Beach's sand and Mediterranean Sea below, as well as the dusky mountains in the distance.The lower station is just behind the beachfront, while the upper station deposits you just outside Alanya Castle's main gate from where you can wander farther up the slope to explore the historic buildings and ruins.<br><b>Address: lower station, Güzelyalı Caddesi, Alanya</b></p>

  <br>
  <h2>4. Boat Trips</h2><br>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2020/08/turkey-alanya-top-things-to-do-boat-trips.jpg">
    <p>Tour boat in Alanya Harbor</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">Take to the sea for easygoing sightseeing with added swimming and sunbathing From around May to October plenty of tour boats depart from Alanya Harbor for day-long trips around the dramatic rocky headland, visiting the sea caves where pirates once hid, along with anchoring off the coast for plenty of swim stops.The main sea caves visited by the boats are Pirate Cave and Damlatas Cave, though depending on the boat, several others can be visited, including Fosforlu Cave and Lovers' Cave.Trips vary hugely in quality. Some boats are basically dedicated party trips, so make sure to check out the operators before departure and get recommendations from your hotel. In general, the smaller boats are usually a better option if you don't want an onboard disco.For a shorter trip, opt for a sunset sail around the harbor.</p>

  <br>
  <h2>5. Soak Up the Sun on Cleopatra Beach</h2><br>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2020/08/turkey-alanya-top-things-to-do-cleopatra-beach.jpg">
    <p>Cleopatra Beach</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;"> Alanya's premier stretch of sand for beach-goers For many visitors, a vacation in Alanya will always be about the beach.The sandy shores, rimmed by resorts, trail the stretch of coastline between Side and Alanya.In Alanya itself, the main strip of sand is Cleopatra Beach, which sits on the western side of town, separated from downtown Alanya by the rocky, forested slope of the castle promontory.This stretch of white sand offers easygoing days of swimming and sunbathing with excellent facilities on hand for a full day at the beach.In the July and August peak season, the beach can get packed. Come in late spring or early fall, though, when the weather here is still sunny and warm, and you'll find this strip of sand surprisingly uncrowded.<br><b>Address: Güzelyalı Caddesi, Alanya</b></p>

  <br>
  <h2>6. Go Underground at Dim Cave</h2><br>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2020/08/turkey-alanya-top-things-to-do-underground-dim-cave.jpg">
    <p>Dim Cave</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">Delve deep into the underground depths to cool off from the summer heat Just a short hop from Alanya (heading 11 kilometers inland), Dim Cave is hollowed out of the western slope of Mount Cebel-i Reis in the Taurus Mountains.This cavern is Turkey's second biggest cave open to visitors, with a walkway running for 360 meters into the cave, heading downwards into the depths for 17 meters below the surface entrance.The limestone interior is littered with giant stalactite and stalagmite formations, all the way down to the lagoon at the cave's lowest level.Bring a jacket or pullover with you, as you'll need it once you're within the cave; it's chilly in here even in the height of summer.The cave entrance area, with its café, has brilliant views of the coastal plateau below.<br><b>Address: Dim Mağarası Yolu, Alanya</b></p>
