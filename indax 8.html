  <h1 style="text-align: center;">7 Top-Rated Attractions in Selçuk</h1><br><br>
  <h2>1. Be Awestruck amid the Vast Ruins of Ephesus</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2021/10/turkey-selcuk-ephesus-top-rated-attractions-awestruck-amid-ruins-ephesus.jpg">
    <p>Ephesus</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">Ephesus is one of Turkey's major sightseeing attractions. This vast and beautiful Greco-Roman city was once home to 250,000 people, and the glorious monuments that remain point to it being a vibrant and rich metropolis.Supposedly founded by the Ionian prince Androclus in the 10th century BCE, Ephesus was not only a center of trade but a great pilgrimage center, with the Temple of Artemis built in worship of the mother goddess.During the Roman era, the city continued to dazzle, and it was only after the Goths destroyed the city in 263 CE that its importance began to wane.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center;">

    <p>Ephesus</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">Don't miss the mammoth library (third largest in the ancient world), the well-preserved theater, the Temple of Hadrian, and the terraced houses complex.The site is huge, so many visitors find hiring a guide allows them to get the most out of their time and understand the site better.</p>
  <br><br>
  <h2>2. Admire Artemis inside Ephesus Museum</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center;">

    <p>Artemis statue in the Ephesus Museum</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">After you've finished visiting Ephesus, head straight to this brilliant museum right in the heart of town.Some of the best finds from the ancient city and the surrounding area are on show here, including two exquisitely carved Artemis statues (one from the 1st century CE and another from the 2nd century CE) famous for their multi-breasted depiction of the goddess.Exhibits cover the entire breadth of Ephesus' history, from the earliest history of settlement (7000 BCE) up to the Byzantine era, but the vast amount of artifacts here cover the classical era, with intricately carved statuary from the city's Pollio Monument and Fountain of Trajan among the standout displays in the collection.Also don't miss the highly detailed ivory frieze, depicting the Roman army, unearthed from the terraced house complex and the bronze statue of an Egyptian priest dating from the 6th century BCE, which showcases the city's long history of trade with its regional neighbors.<br><b>Address: Ugur Mumcu Sevgi Yolu Caddesi, Selçuk</b></p>

  <br><br>
  <h2>3. Explore the Remains of the Basilica of St. John</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2021/10/turkey-selcuk-ephesus-top-rated-attractions-explore-remains-st-john-basilica.jpg">
    <p>Basilica of St. John </p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">This citadel-like basilica once occupied the whole breadth of the hill it sits on and was ranked with the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople (now the Aya Sofya) as one of the Byzantine Empire's largest churches.According to tradition, the grave of St. John is under the church. Originally, a mausoleum with a domed roof borne on four columns was built over the grave, but the Emperor Justinian replaced this simple monument with a three-aisled basilica on a Latin-cross plan boasting six domed roofs.Including the narthex at the western end and the arcaded courtyard, the basilica was 130 meters long and 40 meters wide.After the Seljuks captured Ephesus in 1130, the church was converted into a mosque and later served as a bazaar until it was finally destroyed by an earthquake.Although only partially restored, the basilica ruins that remain give a good idea of the awesome size of the original building.<br><b>Address: St. Jean Sokak</b></p>

  <br><br>
  <h2>4. Visit the Scant Remains of the Temple of Artemis</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2021/10/turkey-selcuk-ephesus-top-rated-attractions-visit-remains-temple-of-artemis.jpg">
    <p>Temple of Artemis </p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">Just one lonely column (topped by a stork's nest) is all that remains of the Temple of Artemis, once one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.Excavations carried out by archaeologist JT Wood here showed that the site was originally occupied by a stone platform on which the cult image of the goddess stood, while underneath were rooms where votive offerings were presented.The renowned gigantic marble temple of Seven Wonders fame was built in the 6th century BCE and boasted a staggering 127 columns.Although destroyed by fire and other disasters across the centuries, it was twice restored and rebuilt before finally falling into a state of complete dilapidation in the Byzantine era, when its stones began being used as a quarry for building material. The most famous major Byzantine monument that reused Temple of Artemis stone was the Hagia Sophia, where some of the temple's columns and marble slabs can still be seen.<br><b>Address: Artemis Sokak</b></p>

  <br><br>
  <h2>5. Pilgrimage to the Meryemana</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/TR/turkey-selcuk-and-ephesus-meryemana.jpg">
    <p>Meryemana</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">The Meryemana is a major Christian pilgrimage site and has a curious history. Tradition holds that the Virgin Mary journeyed to Ephesus with St. John, and is said to have died here.The main building here dates from the Byzantine era (6th century), but its association with the Virgin only began in the 19th century, following the visions of the German nun, Katharina Emmerich, who gave a precise description of the situation and appearance of a house at Ephesus in which she claimed the Virgin had lived and died.In 1891, on the basis of this account, a French priest discovered the ruins of a small church, which had evidently belonged to a monastery and this is now revered as the Virgin's house.The chapel here is tiny, and be aware that the site is often crowded with tour bus groups.A small wishing well is on-site, where it is customary to tie a piece of cloth and make a wish.<br><b>Address: Meryem Ana Yolu</b></p>

  <br><br>
  <h2>6. Soak Up the Views from Ayasuluk Fortress</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2021/10/turkey-selcuk-ephesus-top-rated-attractions-soak-up-views-ayasuluk-fortress-1.jpg">
    <p>Ayasuluk Fortress</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">Ayasuluk Fortress sits on the hill above the Basilica of St. John and is accessed by a trail that leads up from behind the basilica. This hilltop site has been settled since the Neolithic period, but the fortress dates from the Byzantine era, and the fortifications were extended by the Seljuks.The fortress area was closed for years due to archaeologists excavating the site, but it has now been opened to visitors.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/TR/turkey-selcuk-and-ephesus-ayasuluk-fortress.jpg">
    <p>Ayasuluk Fortress</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">The mighty enclosure wall had 15 rectangular towers. Inside, there's not much to see, except for a small Seljuk-era mosque, but the views over town and the surrounding countryside are wonderful from the hilltop, making a trip here well worth the uphill walk.<br><b>Address: St. Jean Sokak</b></p>

  <br><br>
  <h2>7. Admire the Isa Bey Mosque</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/TR/turkey-selcuk-and-ephesus-isa-bey-mosque.jpg">
    <p>Isa Bey Mosque </p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">This Seljuk-era mosque is a beautiful example of the fine architecture of the 14th century. Its tall outer walls enclose a large arcaded courtyard leading to a double-domed prayer hall. The large columns of black granite used in the structure were recycled from the Roman baths.Above the richly decorated main entrance is an elaborate calligraphic inscription. Dated January 10, 1375, it identifies Ali, son of Mushimish al-Damishki, as the architect.Visitors are welcome to visit the interior outside of prayer times. To gain entry, make sure you are dressed appropriately, with shoulders and knees covered. Female visitors should wear a headscarf.<br><b>Address: St. Jean Sokak, Selçuk</b></p>
