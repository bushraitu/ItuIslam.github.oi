  <h1 style="font-size:100px;margin-left: 20px; margin-top:70px;">Ölüdeniz</h1>
  <br>
  <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-left: 100px;">Ölüdeniz sits in a prime position, fronting a curve of a bay fringed by sand and loomed over by the craggy mountain of Babadağ.Having found fame early in Turkey's Turquoise Coast tourism boom, this slice of coast has long since given itself over to summer fun and sun, with plenty of things to do on and off the water.Europeans beeline here every July and August for vacations centered wholly on the sand and sea, while Ölüdeniz's acclaim as one of the world's best places to visit for tandem paragliding brings added bundles of thrill seekers here to throw themselves off Babadağ.Many travelers base themselves in Fethiye, just a short hop away, and head to Ölüdeniz as part of a sightseeing day trip.If you do want to site yourself directly on the sand though, Ölüdeniz's central location along this stretch of coast makes it easy to explore the major tourist attractions beyond the beach.</p>

      <h1>Ölüdeniz Must-See Famous 6 Attractions</h1><br><br>
      <h1>1. Tandem Paragliding</h1><br>
      <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2020/08/turkey-oludeniz-top-things-to-do-tandem-paragliding.jpg">
      <p>Paragliding over Ölüdeniz</p>
    </div>
    <p style="font-size: 25px;">For an adrenaline rush with incredible Mediterranean aerial views, tandem paragliding in Ölüdeniz is one of Turkey's top things to do.From May to October, tandem paragliding tours are organized twice daily (weather permitting) here.Transport from Ölüdeniz, up the winding mountain road to the take-off point on Babadağ (Mount Baba), is included in the tour price.After taking off, it's all about the views. During your descent, you soar over the thickly forested slopes and out above the sparkling blue sea, taking in a bird's-eye perspective of this slice of coastline.If you're comfortable with being adventurous, your guide will do some tricks during the descent. Feel free to say no, if that's not for you and you're happy just gliding.Paragliders land directly on Ölüdeniz Beach, so you can head off for a swim straight afterwards.The Ölüdeniz Paragliding Tour allows you to book your tandem paragliding adventure in advance, before you arrive in town – which can be a good idea if you're planning your trip for the height of summer. The tour includes pick-up from your hotel and the tandem paragliding activity.</p>

      <h1>2. Boat Tours</h1>
      <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2020/08/turkey-oludeniz-top-things-to-do-boat-tours.jpg">
      <p>Boats near Gemiler Island</p>
    </div>
    <p style="font-size: 25px;">From <b>May to around mid-October</b>, tour boat operators offer full-day boat trips starting from the jetty at Ölüdeniz Beach.This is sightseeing at its most easygoing. These trips are all about sunbathing on board, swim stops, and watching the coastal scenery as you cruise by.On the downside, many group-tour boats blast pop music during the trip, so if you're looking for a quieter boat tour experience it can be a better idea to organize a private excursion.The typical Ölüdeniz boat trip itinerary does a loop around the coast, with great views of the dramatic cliffs of the <b>Yedi Burun (Seven Capes)</b> along the way.Nearly all boat trip itineraries stop at Butterfly Valley,<b> Gemiler Island </b>(also known as <b>St. Nicholas Island</b>), and Aquarium Bay for swimming and exploring.Gemiler Island is famous for being the site where many archaeologists believe the original tomb of St. Nicholas (aka Santa Claus) was situated before being uninterred and moved to Myra (modern-day Demre) in the 7th century.The island is home to the ruins of five Byzantine churches, as well as various ecclesiastical buildings and Christian tombs all built between the 4th and 6th centuries.</p>

      <h1>3. Lycian Way Hiking</h1>
      <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2020/08/turkey-oludeniz-top-things-to-do-lycian-way-hiking.jpg">
      <p>Hiker on the Lycian Way</p>
    </div>
    <p style="font-size: 25px;">The Lycian Way,<b> Turkey's most famous long-distance hiking path</b>, has its western trailhead just north of Ölüdeniz.This first section, heading along the Yedi Burun (Seven Capes) from Ölüdeniz to the tiny bay of Kabak, offers some of the best coastal views of the entire 500-kilometer trail.There are also a couple of local trails that connect to the official Lycian Way trail, which make good day hike options for enthusiastic walkers.The short<b> half-day connecting trail from Ölüdeniz Beach</b>, up through the pine-forested slope, and over the hill to Kayaköy is great if you want Mediterranean views. Although it only takes roughly two hours, it's uphill all the way, so you may want to walk it the other way around for less of a slog.</p>

      <h1>4. Seek Out Lycian Tombs in Pınara</h1>
      <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2020/08/turkey-oludeniz-top-things-to-do-seek-out-lycian-tombs-pinara.jpg">
      <p>Pınara Ruins</p>
    </div>
    <p style="font-size: 25px;">Pınara (42 kilometers southeast of Ölüdeniz Beach) may not have as many remaining monuments as other Lycian ruins in the region, but its lonely setting, surrounded by dense forest and with the dusky blue silhouettes of snowcapped mountains in the distance, can't be beaten.As with most of the other Lycian cities along this stretch of coast, a roll-call of conquering empires passed through here, with control of Pınara passing from Greek to Roman to Byzantine command before the site was finally abandoned in the 9th century.The main point of interest here is the large and well-preserved Roman Theater, and Pınara's high cliff face riddled with Lycian rock tombs, some boasting highly ornate facades. Much of the rest of the city monuments lie in scattered ruins, though it's worth hiking around the site to see the many standing Lycian tombs.<b>Address: Yakabağ village, Muğla</b></p>

      <h1>5. Splash About in Saklıkent Gorge</h1>
      <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2020/08/turkey-oludeniz-top-things-to-do-splash-about-saklikent-gorge.jpg">
      <p>Entrance to Saklıkent Gorge</p>
    </div>
    <p style="font-size: 25px;">Saklıkent Gorge (53 kilometers southeast of Ölüdeniz) is one of the most popular day trips from Ölüdeniz during high summer.Most Fethiye-based tour operators run day trips here, with many tours including a stop to explore the ruins of Tlos along the way.These trips can usually be booked directly through Ölüdeniz's hotels, and include hotel pickup and drop-off.Although the gorge isn't particularly dramatic, it's a delightfully shady respite from the summer heat, with the high canyon walls soaring up to 200 meters high.A modern wooden boardwalk trailing along the gorge wall, high above an icy-blue-colored river, provides the entrance into the shaded depths. At the end of the boardwalk, those who want to explore deeper need to first ford the river to the other side to head farther in. If you're going to head on, prepare to get wet.A small café at the point where the boardwalk ends provides snacks, cold drinks, and tea for those who are happy to just relax in the cool canyon climate.<b>Address: Saklıkent Milli Parkı, Muğla</b></p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <h1>6. Visit Letoön</h1>
      <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2020/08/turkey-oludeniz-top-things-to-do-visit-lettoon.jpg">
      <p>Letoön Ruins</p>
    </div>
    <p style="font-size: 25px;">Letoön was the most important cult center of Ancient Lycia and shares its UNESCO World Heritage listing with Xanthos.Unlike other Lycian sites in the region, Letoön wasn't a city. Rather, it was a religious site used by the inhabitants of Xanthos.The religious sanctuary here is home to three temples, which have been partially reconstructed so that some of their pillars have been raised into place. They were dedicated to Lycia's most important deity, the Greek goddess Leto, and her children Artemis and Apollo.Letoön lies just six kilometers south of Xanthos and is easily tagged onto a Xanthos drive trip if you're visiting independently (and is usually included on a Xanthos guided tour).<b>Address: Letoon Caddesi, Kumloava village, Muğla</b></p>
