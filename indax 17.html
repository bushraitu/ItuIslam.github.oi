  <br>
  <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-left: 100px;">Ankara sometimes gets left off people's travel itineraries, which is a shame because Turkey's capital has more to offer than most visitors realize. If one of your prime travel goals is to discover the vast breadth of Turkey's history, Ankara is a great place to visit.Both the country's top museum and Atatürk's mausoleum, two of the country's most important historic tourist attractions, are found here, plus a sightseeing stroll around Ankara's citadel district offers a glimpse of the city's past, before it was promoted to capital status.With its central location, Ankara is also an excellent base from which to jump off on further forays into the Anatolian heartland, where you'll find many archaeological sites and other historical things to do within day-tripping distance.While you're in town, planning whether to head east to Cappadocia, south to Konya, or west to Safranbolu, use our list to help find the top attractions and things to do in Ankara.</p>

      <h1>Ankara Must-See Famous 6 Attractions</h1><br><br>
      <h1>1. Pay Your Respects at the Anitkabir (Atatürk Mausoleum)</h1><br>
      <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2020/05/turkey-ankara-top-attractions-anitkabir.jpg">
      <p>Paragliding over Ölüdeniz</p>
    </div>
    <p style="font-size: 25px;">Ankara's most visited tourist attraction is also Turkey's most important modern pilgrimage site. Sitting on a hilltop, just to the west of the city center, is the mausoleum of Atatürk (Mustafa Kemal), the founder of the state of Turkey.As well as the actual mausoleum, with its lavish use of marble, the site, centered round a vast plaza, contains a large museum complex.It contains both exhibits on the War of Independence, led by Atatürk, which resulted in the birth of Turkey as a modern nation, and displays focused on Atatürk's life.Outside, there are excellent views across Ankara from the arcade that edges the plaza. The mausoleum itself is decorated with gilded inscriptions of Atatürk's speeches.Inside, a cenotaph stands above the placement of Atatürk's tomb. Visitors entering the mausoleum should respect the atmosphere of somber reverence inside as Turks pay their respect to the founder and first president of their modern nation.<b>Address: Yücetepe, 31 Akdeniz Caddesi, Çankaya, Ankara</b></p>

      <h1>2. Explore Ankara's Art Galleries</h1>
      <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2020/05/turkey-ankara-top-attractions-explore-the-galleries.jpg">
      <p>Ankara Painting & Sculpture Museum</p>
    </div>
    <p style="font-size: 25px;">Ankara may not have the modern art scene of Istanbul, but there are two galleries, both in the central city, that are well worth a visit.The most important is the Ankara Painting & Sculpture Museum (Türkocagi Sokak, Hacettepe), which has a large permanent collection of Turkish art from the 19th and 20th centuries. All the major names of the Turkish art scene have works on display here.For completely contemporary art, the CerModern (3 Altinsoy Caddesi, Sihhiye) is Ankara's best site. This gallery, based in a disused train depot building, near Ankara's train station, hosts a regular program of temporary exhibitions focused on both local and international artists.</p>

      <h1>3. Day Trip to Hattuşa</h1>
      <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2022/03/turkey-ankara-top-attractions-things-to-do-day-trip-to-hattusa-lion-gate.jpg">
      <p>The Lion Gate at Hattuşa</p>
    </div>
    <p style="font-size: 25px;">The ruins of Hattuşa, the capital of Anatolia's Bronze Age Hittite empire, sit on the edge of the sleepy village of Boğazkale, 192 kilometers east of Ankara. If you don't want to stay the night in Boğazkale itself, Ankara is the best place to base yourself to day trip to the ruins.During the Bronze Age, the Hittites controlled a vast tract of land that encompassed much of modern-day Turkey and into Syria. Today, the rugged hillside that rises above Boğazkale contains the remnants of their most important city.The most distinctive ruins that have survived are Hattuşa's fortifications, which ring the hillside. In particular, the Yer Kapı's (Earth Gate's) earthen mound, with its 70-meter-long tunnel entrance; the Sphinx Gate, atop the mound; and the Aslanlı Kapı (Lion's Gate), with its stone lions are impressive remnants of the city's vast defensive structures.Just two kilometers from the main ruins is the site of Yazılıkaya, which was Hattuşa's religious sanctuary. The rocks here hold finely carved, well-preserved reliefs showing images of the major Hittite kings giving offerings to their gods.</p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <h1>4. Visit the Archaeological Site of Alacahöyük</h1>
      <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2022/03/turkey-ankara-top-attractions-things-to-do-archaeological-site-alacahoyuk.jpg">
      <p>Main entrance to Alacahöyük</p>
    </div>
    <p style="font-size: 25px;">If you start off from Ankara early enough in the day, you can fit a visit to Alacahöyük into a day trip to Hattuşa.This archaeological site dates back to the Chalcolithic era, and during the early Bronze Age became a center of Anatolia's Hattian culture, which was later absorbed into the Hittite Empire.Alacahöyük is chiefly famous for its royal shaft graves, from which a dazzling cache of decorative gold objects and jewelry was excavated by archaeologists. Most of the grave goods are now on display in Ankara's Museum of Anatolian Civilizations, but the skeletons themselves and a selection of grave goods have been left in situ on-site.The site's fortifications, with a monumental gate entrance decorated with reliefs, and the corbeled tunnel entrance at the back of the site, both dating from Alacahöyük's later Hittite period, are also worth visiting.Alacahöyük is 28 kilometers north of Hattuşa and 196 kilometers east of Ankara.</p>

      <h1>5. Day Trip to Gordion</h1>
      <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2020/05/turkey-ankara-top-attractions-day-trip-to-gordion.jpg">
      <p>Midas Tumulus</p>
    </div>
    <p style="font-size: 25px;">Ankara is the best base for a day trip to the Iron Age Phrygian capital of Gordion. This was the site once home to the legendary King Midas and the location where Alexander the Great cut the Gordion knot.Today, the remnants of this Phrygian city sit amid the fields of the sleepy farming hamlet of Yassihöyük (96 kilometers southwest of Ankara).There are two main sites in the village. The most famous is the Midas Tumulus – an artificial earthen mound over 50 meters high that contains the tomb of a Phrygian king.Despite its name, there is no evidence that the king buried here was actually the Midas of legend. You can walk through a tunnel in the tumulus up to the tomb, though the burial goods found here are in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations, not on-site.There's a small museum across the road from the tumulus, which holds some finds unearthed from the archaeological work here as well.At the other end of the village is the citadel mound, which is home to ruins from a range of eras.Although the ruin layout of various walls, arches, and foundations is rather confusing to non-experts, there are plentiful information panels on the citadel mound, which explain both the site and Gordion's history.<b>Address: Yassihöyük, Polatli</b></p>

      <h1>6. Relax in Gençlik Park</h1>
      <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2020/05/turkey-ankara-top-attractions-genclik-park.jpg">
      <p>Letoön Ruins</p>
    </div>
    <p style="font-size: 25px;">This is Ankara's most central green space. Hugely popular with local families for evening strolls and weekend picnics, Gençlik Park is a good place to visit to take a breather from the capital's hustle.The park has a large lake and various promenades lined by fountains and manicured gardens.The southeast corner of the park is home to Ankara's Luna Park, which holds a number of amusement park rides, including a Ferris wheel, two roller coasters, and plenty of gentler rides such as carousels and bumper cars suitable for younger children.If you're traveling with tots, it's a good place to keep the kids distracted for an hour or two.<b>Address: 50 Atatürk Bulvari</b></p>
