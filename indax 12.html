  <h1 style="text-align: center;">6 Top-Rated Attractions in Pamukkale</h1>
  <br>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">Pamukkale is a surreal natural wonder of rippling semi-circular, pure-white travertines that sit among green farming fields. This pure white hillside is one of Turkey's most photographed spots and the country's most famous natural tourist attraction.Although most visitors come here for the travertines alone, the vast and rambling ruins of the Roman spa town of Hierapolis sit on the travertine hill's summit, making this one of Turkey's best places to visit for historically minded travelers.The top thing to do within the ancient site is to enjoy the mineral-rich waters of the renowned hot spring pool, but beyond, you'll find Hierapolis' grand, well-preserved theater, various temples and monuments, and a large necropolis area.Discover more places to visit with our list of the top tourist attractions in Pamukkale.</p>
  <br><br>
  <h2>1. Walk Up or Down The Travertines</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/TR/turkey-pamukkale-travertines.jpg">
    <p>Travertines</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">The dazzling white calcite cliff of Pamukkale was created by calcium deposits from the area's hot springs. In the same way that stalactites form within limestone caves, the deposits grow on the steep slopes, gradually fanning out to form natural terraces.Pamukkale means "cotton castle," and the blinding white color of these travertines do look like a bizarre natural fortress of sorts.The best way to experience the travertines is to walk up or down the terrace ridge section that leads from the hills base in Pamukkale village to the central entrance to the Hierapolis ancient site on the summit. This is the only section that you can walk on, and you are only allowed onto the travertines barefoot.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center;">

    <p>Travertines</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">At the upper levels here, the half-circle shaped terraces hold pools of water that you wade through (most are from ankle to mid-calf deep) to reach the summit.Once on the top of the hill, there is a wooden walkway that winds most of the length along the top edge of the travertines from where you can get panoramic photos of the travertine hill and the countryside beyond.</p>

  <br><br>
  <h2>2. Explore Hierapolis City Ruins</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2021/10/turkey-pamukkale-top-attractions-explore-hierapolis-city-ruins.jpg">
    <p>Hierapolis City Ruins </p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">First founded by King Eumenes II of Pergamon soon after 190 BCE, Hierapolis was originally a fortified military colony. The original city was destroyed by an earthquake in 60 CE, and it was after the rebuilding that its glory days began.The city enjoyed its greatest prosperity during the 2nd and 3rd century when, with its on-tap natural hot springs, it became an important spa center.The remains of a grand colonnaded street run parallel to the travertines below for just over one kilometer, extending between the necropolis to the north and a Byzantine church at the southern end.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/TR/turkey-pamukkale-hierapolis.jpg">
    <p>Hierapolis City Ruins</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">From the church, if you take the eastern path, you come to the Temple of Apollo and its famed Plutonium (a cave beneath the temple that was a source of poisonous gas). Here, the priests would consult the oracle, bringing in birds and small animals killed by the rising gas.Both the temple and Plutonium are undergoing an extensive restoration and should be reopened for visitors at some stage in 2021.</p>
  <br><br>
  <h2>3. Admire Hierapolis Theater</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/TR/turkey-pamukkale-hierapolis-theatre.jpg">
    <p>Hierapolis Theater</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">On a slope looking over the vast amount of the Hierapolis ruins is the city's mighty theater, with its facade over 100 meters long and two tiers of seating, each with 26 rows.Built during the reigns of the Roman Emperors Hadrian and Septimius Severus, the theater is incredibly well-preserved. It has retained much of its original detail, with the imperial boxes (where VIP guests would have watched the entertainment) and some decorative panels along the stage still surviving. There are fine views from the top seating tiers.If you don't fancy the walk up the hill to see the theater, you can hire one of the drivers of the large golf-cart-type vehicles that wait in front of the antique pool complex to zip you up and then back down again.</p>
  <br><br>
  <h2>4. Pamukkale Antique Pool</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/TR/turkey-pamukkale-antique-pool.jpg">
    <p>Pamukkale Antique Pool</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">If you want to partake in some restorative hot-pool soaking just like the Romans did - but without the togas - then look no further.Pamukkale's Antique Pool, between the museum and the Temple of Apollo, right in the middle of the site, allows you to soothe those weary travel muscles in mineral-rich hot spring water that is a steady 36 degrees Celsius.It's possibly the most atmospheric hot spring experience you'll ever have, with half-submerged columns and chunks of fallen marble scattered in the water all around you, but it's also very popular, so prepare for crowds.Many of the big tour buses that visit Pamukkale do very little in the Hierapolis site except the antique pool and the theater, so if you want to soak without the crowds, try to come early or late.</p>
  <br><br>
  <h2>5. Visit Hieropolis Museum</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2021/10/turkey-pamukkale-top-attractions-visit-hieropolis-museum.jpg">
    <p>Hieropolis Museum</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">This small but excellent museum dedicated to Hierapolis is housed inside the ancient city's former Roman bathhouse, which sits in front of the antique pool complex and just behind the central entrance into the site that leads up from the travertine path.A visit here will help bring the city to life, with the exhibits showcasing some of the beautiful artistry and cultural heritage of this once important city.The museum's three rooms display a variety of finds from the site, including gorgeous and intricate stone reliefs, sarcophagi, and statuary.More stele, column capitals, tombs, and inscribed stone reliefs are displayed in the garden outside</p>
  <br><br>
  <h2>6. Discover Hierapolis' Christian Remnants</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2021/10/turkey-pamukkale-top-attractions-discover-hierapolis-christian-remnants.jpg">
    <p>Hierapolis' Christian Remnants</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">The major surviving Byzantine-era site within the Hierapolis ruins is the Martyrium of the Apostle Phillip, built on the spot where the saint and his children were supposedly martyred after he remonstrated with the pagan worshippers of Hierapolis.The martyrium sits on a ridge, high above the rest of the excavated site and is accessed by a trail that leads from both the trail heading up to the theater and from behind the main city ruins.The martyrium lies across three levels. At the lowest level is a modern bridge that plays the role of the original 4th-century bridge that pilgrims had to cross to access the site. Across the bridge are the remnants of an octagonal Byzantine baths complex.From the baths complex, you climb a staircase to the middle level, where you'll find the pilgrims' fountain and the remains of the Church of the Sepulchre of St. Phillip.Within the scant ruins of the church is a Roman-era tomb dated to the 1st century CE, thought to be the tomb of St. Phillip.Another set of stairs, leads up to the Martyrion, thought to have been built over the site where St. Phillip was martyred. The octagonal layout of the church's interior core can still be easily defined due to the preservation of the archways.There are excellent views across Hierapolis and the travertines from the summit here.</p>
