  <h1 style="margin-left:30px;">Government</h1>
  <p style="margin-left:50px; font-size:25px;">Turkey is a parliamentary representative. Since its foundation as a republic in 1923, Turkey has developed a strong tradition of secularism. Turkey”s constitution governs the legal framework of the country. It sets out the main principles of government and establishes Turkey as a unitary centralized state. The head of the state is the President of the Republic and has a largely ceremonial role. The president is elected for a seven-year term by the parliament but is not required to be one of its members. Executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers; which make up the government, while the legislative power is vested in the unicameral parliament, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature, and the Constitutional Court is charged with ruling on the conformity of laws and decrees with the constitution.<br><br>The Council of State is the tribunal of last resort for administrative cases, and the High Court of Appeals for all others. The Prime Minister is elected by the parliament through a vote of confidence in his government and is most often the head of the party that has the most seats in parliament.There are 550 members of parliament who are elected for a four-year term by a partylist proportional representation system from 85 electoral districts, which represent the 81 administrative provinces of Turkey. To avoid a hung parliament and its excessive political fragmentation, only parties that win at least 10% of the votes cast in a national parliamentary election gain the right to representation in the parliament.</p>

  <div style="margin-left: 70px;"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F953/production/_130272836_8257e31c-8470-4d19-87ab-bb30930257f6.jpg.webp"></div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-left:70px;"><b style="font-size: 20px;">Recep Tayyip Erdogan won a new five-year term as president in elections in May 2023.</b><br><br>He first came to power as prime minister in 2003 following a sweeping electoral victory the previous year by the Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party (AKP), of which he was a founding member.He spent 11 years as Turkey's prime minister before becoming the country's first directly-elected president in August 2014 - a supposedly ceremonial role.To his supporters he has brought Turkey years of economic growth, but to his critics he is an autocratic leader intolerant of dissent who harshly silences anyone who opposes him.In July 2016, the AKP government survived an attempted coup which saw clashes on the streets of Istanbul and Ankara that left 256 people dead.The authorities subsequently detained thousands of soldiers, judges, teachers and civil servants on suspicion of involvement in the attempt, which President Erdogan said was inspired by his exiled opponent Fethullah Gulen.A referendum in April 2017 narrowly backed switching to a presidential system of government, which significantly increased his powers.</p><br>
  
  <h1 style="margin-left:30px;">History</h1><br>
  <img style="margin-left: 70px;" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/BEAA/production/_87101884_turkey_bosphorus.jpg.webp">
  <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-left:70px;">Turkey’s first known human inhabitants appeared in the Mediterranean region as early as 7500 BC, and the cycles of empire building, flexing, flailing and crumbling didn’t take long to kick in. The Great Seljuk Turkish Empire of the 11th century was the first to rule what is now Turkey, Iran and Iraq. The Seljuks were shaken by the Crusades and overrun by Mongol hordes, but they hung onto power until the vigorous, ambitious Ottomans came along. The Ottoman Empire began as the banding together of late 13th century Turkish warriors fleeing the Mongols. By 1453 the Ottomans under Mehmet the Conqueror were strong enough to take Constantinople. Sultan Süleyman the Magnificent (1520-66) oversaw the apogee of the empire: beautifying Constantinople, rebuilding Jerusalem and expanding the Ottoman to the gates of Vienna. But few of the sultans succeeding Suleiman were capable of great rule and the Ottoman Empire’s long, celebrated decline had begun by 1585. By the 19th century, decay and misrule made ethnic nationalism very appealing. The subject peoples of the Ottoman Empire revolted, often with the direct encouragement and assistance of European powers. After bitter fighting in 1832, the Kingdom of Greece was formed; the Serbs, Bulgarians, Rumanians, Albanians, Armenians, Romanians and Arabs would all seek independence soon after.<br><br>The European powers hovered vulturelike over the disintegrating empire, while within Turkey various disastrous attempts to revivify the country were undone by the unfortunate decision to side with Germany in WWI. In 1918, the victorious Allies set to carving up Turkey. At this point, Ottoman general Mustafa Kemal began to organise resistance, sure that a new government must seize the fate of Turkey for the Turkish people. When Greece invaded Smyrna and began pushing east, the Turks were shocked into action. The War of Independence lasted 1920-22, ending in a bitterly won Turkish victory and the abolition of the sultanate. Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk or Father Turk) undertook the job of completely remaking Turkish society. By the time he died in 1938, a constitution had been adopted, polygamy abolished and the fez, mark of Ottoman backwardness, prohibited. Islam ceased to be the official state religion, Constantinople became Istanbul and women obtained the right to vote. Atatürk remains a true hero in Turkey: his statue is everywhere and there are laws against defaming or insulting him.</p><br>
  <h1 style="margin-left:30px;">Culture</h1>
  <img style="float:right; margin-left: 20px;" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559554498-7a9eb7587782?q=80&w=1970&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D" height="400px" width="300px">
  <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-left:70px;">Modern Turkish culture is a complex weave of a very turbulent past, Western liberalism, Muslim traditions, Kemal Atatürk as well as the influence of a number of different ethnical and religious minorities. All of the above accounts for a national culture with some common traits, but also many differences from area to area. The differences within the country are most obvious when traveling between the cities and the rural areas.In the centre of the major cities of Istanbul, Ankara, Antalya etc. life is very much like in the Western world with all its advantages and disadvantages. The rural areas are characterized by a simpler lifestyle effected by Islam and older traditions. However, with 66% of the population living within the cities and a constant flow of people from the countryside to the cities, this is only a general observation. The above also makes it possible for a person, wandering through Istanbul, to walk from one street full of the latest fashion clothing and seeing people dressed in next to nothing; to a street where women clad in headscarves are one their way home from shopping.Regarding the size and the population of Turkey, it is not so fair to talk about a common culture. Turkey, being under the effect of different cultures such as Arabic, Persian, Caucasian, Kurdish, Balkan, Laz and even French and also many others like climate, geography etc., is hosting a huge pile of cultural diversity. Traditions, food may show similarities but at the end you will have chance to see that how differences may come together and stay still aside with its own richness.You may witness several different dances and wedding ceremonies from different regions in Turkey.</p><br>

  <h1 style="margin-left:30px;">Religion</h1><br>
  <img style="margin-left:70px; float:left; margin-right:30px" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1519834089823-08a494ba5a12?w=500&auto=format&fit=crop&q=60&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MTF8fHR1cmtleSUyMG1vc3F1ZXxlbnwwfHwwfHx8MA%3D%3D">
  <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-left:70px;">Islam is the largest religion in Turkey. More than 99 percent of the population is Muslim, mostly Sunni. Christianity (Oriental Orthodoxy, Greek Orthodox and Armenian Apostolic) and Judaism are the other religions in practice, but the non-Muslim population declined in the early 2000s.Turkey is a secular state with no official religion since the constitutional amendment in 1924. To some Turks, Islam is an important part of Turkish life, but the country is very tolerant of all religions, and faiths.Around 70% of the population is Sunni Muslims, the next largest religious group are Alevi community, who follow a nonorthodox form of Islam, and make up about 25% of the population.Turkey has several historical mosques, the national mosque is the Sultan Ahmed Mosque (also known as the blue mosque) in Istanbul, but other notable ones include The Süleymaniye Mosque, Hagia Sofia (now a museum, formerly a mosque and before that a church) both also in Istanbul. Kocatepe Mosque in Ankara, and Alâeddin Mosque in Konya are also noteworthy, and there are also several churches and synagogues in the country.Turkey also has several historical Christian sites, including Göreme in Cappadocia, which was the site of one of the earliest Christian settlements, and is now a major tourist attraction; mainly because the settlement was created by digging caves into the rock-face. There are many different “cave churches” in the Cappadocia region most of which feature frescoes of Christ, and these are usually from the time of the crusades.Antioch (Antakya), the city where “the disciples were first called Christians” according to the biblical Book of Acts, is located in modern Turkey, as are most of the areas visited by St. Paul during his missions.Turkey is fairly moderate in terms of religion, and generally a lot more relaxed about it than Middle Eastern countries, such as Iran or Syria. There is also a significant proportion of the population that class themselves as Muslim, but do not participate in religious obligations, and are maybe better classified as “believing in Islam”, than “active Muslims”.</p>

  <h1 style="margin-left:30px;">Education</h1>
  <img style="margin-left:70px; float:left; margin-right:30px" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1523050854058-8df90110c9f1?w=500&auto=format&fit=crop&q=60&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MTJ8fGVkdWNhdGlvbnxlbnwwfHwwfHx8MA%3D%3D">
  <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-left:70px;">Education is one of the fundamental functions of the state and performed under state control and supervision. The Ministry of National Education (MoNE) is responsible for offering the educational services; the right to education is ensured by the Constitution.Formal education includes pre-school education, primary education, secondary education and higher education institutions. There are both public (free of charge) and private schools providing education for all these levels.<br><br><b>Pre-school Education:</b> It is optional for the children between 3-5 years old. Preschool education is provided by independent nurseries and a variety of ministries and institutions in kindergardens, nurseries and preparatory classes as well as day care and children care centers.<br><br><b>Primary Education:</b> For children between 6 and 14 years old, compulsory and free of charge in public schools. Primary education is uninterrupted for 8 years and the graduates receive a primary education diploma.<br><br><b>Secondary Education:</b> Secondary education is divided into two as general and vocational & technical education. General high schools offer 4 years of education for 15-18 years old to prepare them for higher education. They include the Anatolian High Schools (schools offering education in a foreign language), High Schools, Science Schools, Anatolian Teacher Training Schools, Anatolian Fine Arts schools and multi- curriculum high schools.<br><br>
  <img style="margin-left:30px; float:right;" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1568792923760-d70635a89fdc?w=500&auto=format&fit=crop&q=60&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MTV8fHVuaXZlcnNpdHl8ZW58MHx8MHx8fDA%3D">
  Vocational and technical high schools train the qualified manpower required in various fields of industry and prepare students for professional life as well as higher education. They include technical schools for boys, vocational schools for girls, vocational schools for commerce and hotel management and religious high schools.Turkish education system is highly academic and teacher centered. There is a solid exam system, in which students have to get prepared almost all through their education life to get a better education opportunity. For this reason, in Turkey there are too many private high schools, which are quite popular amongst the parents and the students that can afford.The national exam after primary education defines which type of school the student is going to study. Anatolian High schools, science schools and some popular private high schools only accept students according to the ranking of the student in the exam.Thus, starting from the early years of their secondary education, the students also attend to private courses as to support their school life and get better prepared for the national exams. This fact makes young people’s life occupied mainly by education and only a limited time remains for social activities.In all secondary schools, students wear uniforms as a rule. The style and the colors may differ from school to school, which is also considered as the identity of the school.Except the few existing examples of schools for only girls or boys, at all schools girls and boys are studying together.Depending on the facilities of the school, different social activities are available for the students. Most of the social activities are based on sports and music. All schools may have different student clubs. The efficiency of the clubs depend on the students and the support of the school. Private schools are more remarkable in terms of the social activities they offer.<br><br><b>Higher education:</b> Higher education is offered by several state and private universities. There are higher vocational schools, offering practical education for 2 years and academic universities providing undergraduate studies for 4 years, except medical studies vary from 5 to 6 years. An additional 2 years is required for graduate degrees. All universities accept students according to the results of the national university exams. Every year more than 1.5 million students enter this exam in order to be able to get into a good university.<br><br><b>Exchange Students:</b> Exchange students, are placed in a high school matching their age and the studies they have completed in their home country. Students are placed in General High Schools, Anatolian High Schools or Private High Schools that YFU Turkey is cooperating with.<br><b> Exchange students do not pay any tuition fee, but they all have to pay for school transportation, school lunch, school uniforms and books regardless of the type of school they are placed in.</b></p>
