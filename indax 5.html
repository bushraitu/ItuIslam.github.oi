  <p style=" font-size:25px;">High on every tourist's Turkey hit list, Cappadocia is a region of swirling volcanic-rock landscapes so otherworldly, they look like they have been fashioned by mischievous elves.These days, the region's star tourist attraction is hot air ballooning, but don't make the mistake of thinking that's all there is for you to do.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size:25px;">Humans settled this area since at least the Bronze Age and have left their own mark on this wacky moonscape by burrowing into the soft volcanic rock to live, leaving behind villages carved out of hillsides, Byzantine-era rock-cut churches holding dazzling frescoes, and labyrinthine underground cities where Cappadocians once huddled from invading armies.

If you want to split your time here between both the historic sites and the area's natural beauty, I recommend making sure you give yourself enough time. Plenty of visitors arrive in Cappadocia thinking they can knock it off in two days and leave frustrated at how little they've managed to see.

While those Instagram aerial shots showcasing the sinewy contours of Cappadocia's valleys may have made this one of the most popular places in the world to take a hot-air balloon tour, this region is brimming with other things to do.

So loosen up your itinerary a bit and read on to plan your Cappadocia trip.</p>
  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Attractions around Göreme</h1><br>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size:25px;">Göreme is the little village right at the heart of the Cappadocia tourism scene, and in high summer it heaves with visitors.The village is half burrowed into the hill, with its stone house facades hiding a maze of cave rooms below. Many of these traditional houses have been turned into boutique cave hotels, and despite its full-gear tourism vibe, if you want to be able to access the most famous valleys and sights easily on foot, it's still my top recommendation as a base for your stay.If you're ready to put in the hours, you can complete these five top attractions in one long day but be prepared for an early start because you'll be up at the crack of dawn for your hot air balloon tour.</p>
  <br>

  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size:25px;">For many visitors, going for an early morning hot-air balloon ride in Cappadocia is one of Turkey's highlights.In the summer high season, over 100 hot-air balloons take to the skies just after sunrise and supply passengers with bird's-eye views of the central valley area and its rock formations.Balloons fly daily throughout the year unless they're canceled due to inclement weather. The typical flight plan flies over the area containing Red, Rose, and Meskendir Valleys, though sometimes the wind conditions mean you fly over other surrounding areas.</p>
  <br>
  <h2 style="margin-left: 120px;">The Ballooning Experience in Cappadocia</h2><br>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2020/08/turkey-cappadocia-hot-air-ballooning-the-ballooning-experience.jpg">
  </div>
  <p style="text-align: center;">Hot air balloons preparing for an early morning departure in Cappadocia</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size:25px;">Hot air ballooning is an early-morning activity (the first hour of daylight is the safest time for ballooning), so set your alarm and prepare to be waking up before the birds.All the balloon companies pick up passengers directly from their hotels, which makes this before-daybreak start more manageable.You're picked up before dawn (exact times are confirmed by the balloon company the day before and depend on both the time of year and your hotel location) and transferred first to the balloon company office.Once there, a breakfast is provided while the balloon company organizes the day's flight, gathers up all the other passengers from their various hotels, and processes payments from passengers. (Although your credit card number is taken on booking, the payment is only processed on the morning of your flight.)The breakfast depends on the company, but the better companies put on excellent spreads.When all the pre-flight organization is completed, you are transferred by minibus or 4WD to the balloon launch site, where you'll watch the balloon being inflated in the first light of dawn.Everyone then climbs into the basket, ready for takeoff. Passengers with mobility issues or less dexterity will be helped by the ground crew.The fully inflated balloon then lifts off, and you're away.</p>
  <br>
  <h2 style="margin-left: 120px;">In Flight</h2><br>
  <div style="text-align: center;">

  </div>
  <p style="text-align: center;">Balloons over Cappadocia's Fairy Rock formations</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size:25px;">One of the reasons Cappadocia is so popular for hot air ballooning is because balloons here are allowed to descend so low to the ground during flight due to the lack of wildlife.This means you get to experience the full scope of the weird and wacky landscape of this region, both up close and far above.During the flight, you'll ascend at times up to around 900 meters (3,000 feet) high allowing you incredible bird's-eye overviews of the sinewy valley networks.When you're descending, you'll sometimes fly over the orchard-filled plateaus and into the valleys themselves.Here, wind permitting, balloons can skim near the tops of Cappadocia's "fairy chimney" rock formations from just above, to better see these geological oddities that were carved from millennia of wind and water action.The flight captain also acts as your tour guide during the flight, and will point out local topographical features.All flight captains speak English, as well as Turkish, and some are also able to add commentary in other languages such as Japanese, German, and Dutch.While you're in the balloon, the company's ground crew are chasing you back on land below, and will meet the balloon as it descends at the landing site, which changes according to the day's wind.On days with perfect weather conditions, the balloon will often be able to land directly on the ground crew's trailer.</p>
  <br>
  <h2 style="margin-left: 120px;">Types of Flights</h2><br>
  <div style="text-align: center;">

  </div>
  <p style="text-align: center;">Winter ballooning in Cappadocia</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size:25px;">A standard hot air balloon ride in Cappadocia lasts between 45 minutes and one hour, and the baskets used are usually made to fit either 16, 20, or 24 passengers plus the flight captain.The price typically includes all of the experience; pickup and drop-off at your hotel, breakfast beforehand, and drinks and snacks afterwards.Most companies offer a higher-end hot air ballooning tour option. The only major difference is basket size, which is usually between 12 and 16 passengers, and flight time, which is usually a minimum of 75 minutes in the air.The most exclusive option is to book a private hot air ballooning tour for your family or group. On private flights, the basket accommodates the number of people in your group, and the flight time is usually 75 minutes.</p>
  <br>

  <h2 style="margin-left: 120px;">Balloon Cancellations</h2><br>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2020/08/turkey-cappadocia-hot-air-ballooning-balloon-cancellations-1.jpg">
  </div>
  <p style="text-align: center;">Balloons at dawn</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size:25px;">Ballooning is a year-round activity, but bad weather or dangerous wind conditions can ground balloons for safety reasons, and obviously this can't be planned for.Early spring and winter are the seasons that are most usually affected by balloon cancellations, but they also happen occasionally during the peak summer season.Due to the nature of the activity, confirmation of flight cancellation can happen on the morning of your scheduled flight, even after you've been ferried to the balloon company office for breakfast. Although unfortunate and disappointing, this cannot be avoided.The balloon companies offer full flight refunds if a balloon grounding occurs, or, if possible, they'll bump you onto the next day's flight. Be aware, though, that due to hot air ballooning's burgeoning popularity, this latter solution is becoming less available particularly during the summer season, as balloons are often fully booked for days in advance.</p>
  <br><br>
  <h2 style="margin-left: 120px;">2. Visit the Churches of Göreme Open-Air Museum</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center;"><br>
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2019/02/turkey-cappadocia-top-attractions-goreme-open-air-museum.jpg">
  </div>
  <p style="text-align: center;">Göreme Open-Air Museum</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size:25px;">Just outside the village of Göreme is the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Göreme Open-Air Museum, a monastery cluster of rock-cut churches and monk cells that hold fabulous frescoes, and first launched Göreme onto the tourism map.The complex frescoes date from the 10th to 12th centuries, when Cappadocia was an important Byzantine religious center.There are several churches and chapels to explore within the complex, but make sure you don't miss the Elmalı (Apple) Church (note its Ascension fresco above the door); the Azize Barbara (St. Barbara) Chapel with its red-ochre interior decoration; and the Yılanlı (Snake) Church, with its frescoes of St. George, and of the hermetic hermaphrodite St. Onuphrius.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center;">

  <p style="text-align: center;">Frescos in Karanlık (Dark) Church | Photo Copyright: Jess Lee</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size:25px;">Göreme Open-Air Museum's two highlights are the cavernous Tokalı (Buckle) Church, with its barrel-vaulted chamber completely covered in frescoes, and the Karanlık (Dark) Church.The superbly restored, colorful frescoes within the Karanlık (Dark) Church are regarded as among the best surviving examples of mid-Byzantine art in the world.Unsurprisingly, being Cappadocia's most well-known historic sight, Göreme Open-Air Museum tends to be busy for much of the day. I recommend trying to visit immediately on opening time at 8am and, if possible, avoiding weekends.</p>

  <br>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size: 25px;">Cappadocia's most beautiful intertwining valleys stretch north and east of Göreme in a triangle that connects Çavusin village (north) and Ortahisar village (east).

Here, the rolling and rippling rock faces arc out across the countryside in a palette of pastel pink, yellow, and orange cliffs, formed by volcanic explosion and then hewn into shape by millennia of wind and water erosion whittling away the rock.

Between the cliffs are lush orchards and vegetable plots still tended by local farmers, while carved into the rock are hidden churches and hermit hideouts, which date back to the Byzantine era.

Hot-air ballooning over the valleys gets all the glory, but in my opinion, the best way to experience the valleys is up-close and on foot.

Even better, despite the fact that Cappadocia's sweeping landscapes are one of its major highlights, only a smidge of the region's visitors ever bother heading out for a hike. Once you're away from the outskirt areas where the ATVs buzz around (kicking up so much dust that they end up obscuring the landscapes their passengers have paid to see) you'll often have the vistas of accordion rippled cliffs and deep valleys punctured by rock cones all to yourself.</p>

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2023/10/turkey-cappadocia-attractions-rose-valley-rock-formations.jpg">
  </div><br>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size: 25px;">There are dozens of hiking trails to choose from and hikes range from a couple of hours to all-day treks.

<b>If you only have time for one hike, center your attention on Rose Valley</b>, where you can walk between three of the valley area's prettiest little cave churches.

My favorite is the Kolonlu (Column) Church, with its columns hewn out of the rock. From there you can take the rock steps up onto the ridge and hike to the Haçlı (Cross) Church, with its mammoth cross carved into the cave ceiling, before heading north to the Üç Haçlı (Three Cross) Church, with its well-preserved ceiling carvings and interesting (though severely damaged) frescoes.

Horse riding through this valley area is also very popular. Most rides are more suitable for intermediate riders rather than beginners due to the rocky terrain.</p>
  <br><br>
  <h2 style="margin-left: 120px;">4. Explore the Village of Göreme</h2><br>
  <div style="text-align: center;">

  </div>
  <p style="text-align: center;">Village of Göreme in winter</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size: 25px;">Sticking closer to the village, the fresco-adorned El Nazar (Evil Eye) Church and the Saklı (Hidden) Church are both accessed off Müze Caddesi, a short walk from the center on the way east to Göreme Open-Air Museum.If you explore the valley of stubby hoodoos on the village's southern rim, make sure to look out for the Durmuş Kadir Church, carved out of a low hill.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2019/01/turkey-cappadocia-top-attractions-goreme.jpg">
  </div>
  <p style="text-align: center;">Göreme</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size: 25px;">There are no frescoes to see inside, but the basilica with its nine-meter high barrel-vaulted ceiling and two aisles of chunky square columns is one of the best places to appreciate the architectural ambition of this region's Byzantine church builders.</p>

  <br><br>
  <h2 style="margin-left: 120px;">5. Bed Down in a Cave</h2><br>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size: 25px;">In many destinations, your hotel only features as a practical necessity in vacation plans, but Cappadocia's accommodation choices are an attraction of a visit in themselves. Göreme's cave hotels host rooms burrowed into the village's hills, and many have been refurbished and restored from traditional village homes.There is a vast selection of hotel choices here, so my top tips for booking are:First, if you decide you definitely want to sleep in a cave, remember this means you most likely won't get a view from your room. Cave rooms are - by their nature - situated on the lower floors, while the accommodation referred to as stone-cut rooms (built from local stone) sit on upper levels.Many of the cave hotels are boutique style with a choice of between five and twelve rooms in total, of which only a few will be caves. If you find somewhere you really like the look of, it's a good idea to book as early as possible.Due to Göreme's burgeoning popularity, many of the cave hotels are pricey in comparison with hotel prices elsewhere in Turkey. This is a place to treat yourself when it comes to your accommodation budget.If your budget can't stretch that far though, there are still a scatter of places in town holding on to Göreme's backpacker roots, offering beds in dorm caves and usually also with a couple of tiny private cave rooms.</p><br>

  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size: 25px;">All of these next attractions sit in, or around, Cappadocia's central villages; a roughly triangular-shaped area with Uçhisar at the southwest point, Ürgüp at the southeast, Avanos to the north, and Göreme in the middle.Many of these feature as stops on Cappadocia day tours but, if you're like me and enjoy hopping about on public transport, and don't want to be constricted in your exploring by a tour's itinerary, all of these following attractions are easily accessed by local dolmuş (minibus) services.The hourly Ürgüp-Avanos dolmuş is particularly helpful if you're an independent traveler, and is my favorite easy - and cheap - way to explore this area.It leaves on the hour and, running from Ürgüp, passes by Ortahisar, Göreme, Çavusin, Paşabağı, and Zelve Open-Air Museum on its way to Avanos. From Avanos, it runs the same route in reverse.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;">Uçhisar's Rock Citadel</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size: 25px;">The village of Uçhisar is dominated by a mammoth rock-cut fortress riddled with tunnels and caves.Just like the region's underground cities, this rocky outcrop provided villagers with protection from invaders during the Roman and Byzantine eras.This is the highest point in the central Cappadocia villages area, so you'll want to climb to the top, to be rewarded with sweeping panoramas over the undulating valleys that surround the village.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;">Uçhisar</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size: 25px;">Uçhisar is also a popular base for visitors, with plenty of boutique cave hotel accommodations.The village is a good starting point for valley walks. For a full morning or afternoon exploring around Uçhisar, I like to take the Pigeon Valley trailhead, which runs from the southwest edge of Göreme. The trail route is lined with rock cones, many of which have colorful, decorated dovecotes.To access Uçhisar minus the sweat, the half-hourly dolmuş (local bus) service between Göreme and Nevşehir (the nearest city) runs past the village and Uçhisar also has its own separate half-hourly dolmuş service to Nevşehir.</p>
