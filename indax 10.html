  <h1 style="text-align: center;">7 Top-Rated Attractions in Bodrum</h1>
  <br>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">Bodrum is Turkey's Turquoise Coast at its most vibrant. This unabashed summer vacation destination is known for its marina full of bobbing yachts ready to whisk you out onto the Aegean for a lazy day of coastal sightseeing between swimming stops; a handful of historic tourist attractions, if you're looking for more things to do off the beach; and a town filled with photogenic, old whitewashed houses.Once the ancient city of Halicarnassus, Bodrum had turned into a simple fishing village by the late-Ottoman era, but all that changed in the mid-20th century, when tourism entered the fold.Now during summer, this town is one of the best places to visit in Turkey for sun-and-sea vacations, and it buzzes with energy as tourists come from all over the world to soak up Bodrum's charm.If you happen to visit out of season, though, you can still catch a hint of the old village atmosphere. Plan your time in Turkey's premier resort town with our list of the top tourist attractions and things to do in Bodrum.</p>
  <br><br>
  <h2>1. Soak Up the Scenery on a Boat Trip</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center;">

  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">Bodrum is all about the sea. The vast amount of visitors that arrive are here for a lazy holiday of sun, sea, and sand, but when you feel the need for a change of scenery, the most popular way to sightsee is by boat.Hundreds of boat tours are on offer during the summer months, ranging from a day trip sailing around the Bodrum Peninsula, stopping off at tiny inlets only accessible by boat for swimming, to multi-day yacht trips down the coast or across to the Greek Islands.Bodrum's marina is where public and private yacht trip outfitters tout for business, though most visitors looking for a day-long or half-day boat trip prefer to book a recommended operator through their hotels.Even on the short day and half-day trips, you'll be able to experience a good chunk of the Aegean's famed rocky coastline scenery and have hours of sunbathing on board, broken up by swimming stops.When booking, check where your swimming stops will be. If possible you want to anchor off Orak Island, east off the coast of Bodrum Town, where the water is so clear, shallow, and shaded light turquoise that people nickname it the Turkish Maldives.If you're on a private boat trip, so can curate your own itinerary, get to Orak Island before 10am or after 4pm to enjoy the bay at its quietest.</p>

  <br><br>
  <h2>2. Visit the Castle of St. Peter</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/TR/turkey-bodrum-castle-of-st-peter.jpg">
    <p>Castle of St. Peter</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">Lording over the seafront, the Castle of St. Peter is at the top of every visitor's things to do in Bodrum list.The Knights Hospitallers of St. John built the structure between 1402 and 1437, and knights of the various nationalities of the order were entrusted with the defense of particular sections of the walls.Among the various towers are the French Tower; the English Tower, with a sculpted lion on its west wall; and the Gatineau Tower, which leads to the dungeons.During the reign of the Ottoman sultan Süleyman the Magnificent, the castle passed into Turkish hands and a mosque was built inside.Today, many of the vast halls inside the castle display the exhibits of Bodrum's Museum of Underwater Archaeology.<br><b>Address: Kale Caddesi, Bodrum Town</b></p>
  <br><br>
  <h2>3. Explore History at the Museum of Underwater Archaeology
</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2021/10/turkey-bodrum-top-rated-attractions-things-to-do-explore-history-museum-underwater-archaeology.jpg">
    <p>Museum of Underwater Archaeology</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">The absolutely brilliant Bodrum Underwater Archaeology Museum inside the Castle of St. Peter is a must-see attraction, even if you don't have an interest in underwater archaeology. It has been recently reorganized and renovated, with the exhibits displayed in various halls of the castle's upper level.The artifact displays, which hail both from underwater discoveries off the coast here and excavations on the Bodrum Peninsula, are complemented by slick multimedia displays.The museum's highlight is the Serçe Limanı Glass Wreck room, which displays a 16-meter Byzantine ship that sunk in 1026 CE. Some of its cargo, including amphorae and glass artifacts, is displayed artfully in the surrounding exhibit cases.Other halls display finds recovered from several Bronze Age shipwrecks, a large collection of amphorae, and intricately decorated ceramic pieces uncovered from a Mycenaean-era necropolis near Ortakent on the peninsula.<br><b>Address: Castle of St. Peter, Kale Caddesi, Bodrum Town</b></p>

  <br><br>
  <h2>4. Enjoy Water Sports on the Aegean</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2021/10/turkey-bodrum-top-rated-attractions-things-to-do-get-active-aegean.jpg">
    <p>Paddleboarding off the Aegean Peninsula</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">Boat trips may be the favored way to get out onto the water in Bodrum, but more active visitors can choose from a range of water sports offered at the different beaches of the peninsula.Kayak hire is popular at beaches such as Bitez, Ortakent, and Gümbet, while those looking for more thrills can opt to go parasailing at these three beaches as well. Paddleboarding has recently been gaining in popularity and is now offered at various beaches along the peninsula, including at Turgutreis and at Camel Beach in Ortakent.There are also options for more specialist water sports, such as kiteboarding, with a couple of operators who work in the Bodrum area.One of the most professional outfits is Kiteboard Bodrum which is based on Celebi Island, offshore from Ortakent. They offer kiteboarding lessons from beginner to advanced levels as well as equipment rental, with transfers to the island included in their prices.</p>

  <br><br>
  <h2>5. Take in the Best Sunset View from Bodrum's Historic Windmills Site</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2021/10/turkey-bodrum-top-rated-attractions-things-to-do-take-sunset-view-bodrums-historic-windmills-site.jpg">
    <p>Windmill in Bodrum at sunset</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">The hill that separates Bodrum Bay and Gümbet Bay is topped with the sparse remains of Bodrum's windmills.The windmills themselves are not worth the visit, but the panoramic vistas that stretch across the bays of both Bodrum and Gümbet are, and it's a very popular spot to watch the sun set.Though most people come here by car, the hilltop is an easy two-kilometer walk from Bodrum marina, up a medium slope. Don't try to walk it during the midday heat, though.To walk here, head to the very western end of Bodrum marina and veer uphill on Osman Nuri Bilgin Caddesi. At the top of the hill, turn onto Haremtan Sokak and follow this summit road until you arrive at the windmills.The best time for strolling up here is in the early morning, when fresh breezes make it a pleasant activity rather than a slog. The site is also at its quietest during this time, so you can soak up the Bodrum Bay vistas without the crowds.<br><b>Address: Haremtan Sokak, Bodrum Town</b></p>
  <br><br>
  <h2>6. Day Trip to Stratonikeia</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2021/10/turkey-bodrum-top-rated-attractions-things-to-do-day-trip-stratonikeia.jpg">
    <p>Stratonikeia</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">The ancient site of Statonikeia is within easy day-tripping distance from Bodrum, but surprisingly receives very few visitors. If you've visited more famous ancient cities, such as Ephesus, on your Turkey itinerary, a stroll around the ruins here with barely another visitor in sight makes for a refreshing change.The site has been settled since the Bronze Age Hittite era, but the oldest monuments still standing today date from the Classical Age, when Stratonikeia became an important link on the local trade routes.Unlike many Greco-Roman cities, Stratonikeia was continuously settled up until the early years of the modern Turkish Republic as the village of Eskihisar.Although the village was eventually moved a couple of kilometers away from Stratonikeia, several families continue to inhabit the site itself, and several Ottoman-era monuments and mansions dating from the 19th century have been preserved, along with the older ruins.This makes Stratonikeia a uniquely stratified site, where you can stroll from the Hellenistic theater, sliced into the hillside, through lanes lined with crumbling and derelict Ottoman-era stone houses, to the impressive double-arched northern gate.Stratonikeia is along the main Bodrum-Muğla Highway, 75 kilometers northeast from Bodrum Town.</p>
  <br><br>
  <h2>7. Visit Bodrum Theater</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/TR/turkey-bodrum-theatre.jpg">
    <p>Bodrum Theater</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">Bodrum Theater may be small by Roman standards, but it has been decently restored, and the views from the upper tiers, out towards Bodrum Bay, are superb.In its heyday during the 4th century, it would have held 13,000 spectators.If you're here in summer, Bodrum uses the theater for a program of events and concerts. Check out if there's anything on while you're in town, as seeing a performance within the theater is the best way of imagining how it would have been used in the grand era of Halicarnassus.Directly across the road from the theater, you can get panoramic photos looking down onto central Bodrum.<br><b>Address: Kıbrıs Şehitleri Caddesi, Bodrum Town</b></p>
