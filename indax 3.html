  <h2 style="margin-left: 120px;">Hagia Sophia</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px;font-size: 25px;">Often referred to as the eighth wonder of the World, the Hagia Sophia (Ayasofya in Turkish) in Sultanahmet is easily one of Istanbul's most impressive sights. It also must have one of the most turbulent histories of any landmark in the world. To find out why, it's best to look back through its previous incarnations:</p>
  <h2 style="margin-left: 120px;">The Hagia Sophia Church (360 CE –)</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px;font-size: 25px;">The structure that stands today was actually the third church to be built on this site. The first two (built in 360  CE and 415 CE respectively) were both razed to the ground in troubled Byzantine times. Emperor Justinian commissioned the current building in the sixth century as a Greek Orthodox Church that would outdo the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. It took just five years and the manpower of nearly 11,000 people to erect the structure that was the largest Christian church in the world for nearly a thousand years. In 1204, the Crusaders displaced the Patriarch of Constantinople with a Latin bishop, which is why much of its original relics can now be found in St. Mark's Basillica in Venice. You can visit Hagia Sophia, either with our private One Day in Istanbul or Istanbul Layover tour.</p>
  <h2 style="margin-left: 120px;">The Hagia Sophia Mosque (1453 – )</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size: 25px;">Following the capture of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks in 1453, and the subsequent pillaging that ensued, Mehmet the Conqueror declared the Hagia Sophia a mosque, and said his prayers there the very next Friday. As a mosque, it was considered as one of the holiest Islamic temples of the world. It also served as Istanbul's principal mosque for nearly 500 years and was used as a model for many others including the Sultan Ahmed Mosque , the Suleymaniye Mosque and the Rustem Pasha Mosque.</p>
  <h2 style="margin-left: 120px;">The Hagia Sophia Museum (1935 – 2020)</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size: 25px;">Under the order of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and the Council of Ministers the Hagia Sophia Turkey opened as a museum in 1935. Today, it is visited by nearly 10,000 people per day and the Turkish Ministry of Tourism declared that it received more than 3 million visitors in 2013. On 17 July 2020 - following an unexpected and surprising decision taken by the Turkish government - Hagia Sophia Museum was converted back to a mosque after 85 years.</p>

  </div>
  <h2 style="margin-left: 120px;">Amazing facts..</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size: 25px;">The dome of the Hagia Sophia Turkey is 180 feet high and 100 feet wide and was considered a revolution in the history of architecture. Today, the massive dome is surrounded by four minarets which were built during the Ottoman period.Most of the Christian mosaics of the temple are located in the upper gallery of the temple which was once the women section during both the Byzantine and Ottoman eras. The oldest mosaic dates back to the 9th century CE.The architect Sinan was so vexed by the impressive dimensions and architecture of the Hagia Sophia, that he spent his life trying to better it. He finally achieved this with his masterpiece, the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne whose dome is said to be just inches bigger.</p>
  <br><br>
  <h1 style="margin-left: 120px;">2. Landmarks of Istanbul – the Blue Mosque</h1>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size: 25px;">Wondering which sights in Istanbul trump the grandeur of Hagia Sofia? The gauntlet was taken up in 1609 by Sultan Ahmed I, who created a true architectural icon of the city! The Blue Mosque, as it is referred to, has as many as six minarets - four at the corners of the building and two at the edges of the courtyard. Together with the myriad of domes, they form an incredible spatial programme! The colour of the mosque is also hugely impressive, achieved by thousands of closely arranged blue tiles.<br><br>Interested in free Istanbul attractions? Get ready for an amazing sound experience as the muezzins call to prayer - at one point, from all the minarets in Istanbul! The singing call to prayer breaking through the noise of the big city makes Istanbul freeze for a moment. If this is your first time in a Muslim country, be prepared for a real thrill!</p>

  <h1 style="margin-left: 120px;">Blue Mosque (Sultanahmet Mosque)</h1>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px;">Also known as the Sultan Ahmet Camii (or Sultan Ahmed Mosque), this breath-taking building is one of the most majestic Ottoman mosques in all of Turkey.</p>
  <h2 style="margin-left: 120px;">Blue Mosque History</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size: 25px;">The Blue Mosque was built between 1609 and 1616, by the architect Mehmet Ağa, instructed by Sultan Ahmed I. It was designed as an imperial show of strength to complement the imposing Hagia Sophia Mosque, which faces it across Sultanahmet Square. Unlike the Hagia Sophia, however, it is supported by four "elephant foot" pillars and the central dome (23.5m in diameter and 43m high) is flanked by four semi-domes, making it nearly a square in shape. It is dubbed the Blue Mosque because of over 20,000 handmade ceramic Iznik tiles that decorate the interior, featuring many different tulips, rose, carnation, and lily designs, well lit by 260 windows.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-left: 120px;">Amazing facts about Blue Mosque</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size: 25px;">Aside from its staggering size and exquisite beauty, one of the most distinctive elements of this Istanbul mosque is that it has six minarets, as opposed to the usual two or four of most of the city’s mosques. In the history of the Blue Mosque, legend has it that this is because of a misunderstanding – when the Sultan decreed there should be altın minaret (gold minarets), the architect heard altı minaret (six minarets) – an easy mistake to make! This caused some controversy, as the only other mosque with six minarets at that time was the Prophet’s mosque in Mecca – a problem the sultan overcame by ordering a seventh to be added in Mecca.</p>

<br><br>
  <h1 style="margin-left: 120px;">3. Suleymaniye Mosque</h1>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size: 25px;">Visiting the centre of Istanbul? The attractions that await you are countless! You will find, among others, the Suleiman Mosque, slightly smaller and older than the others. The building was built back in the heyday of Suleiman the Magnificent's empire and was meant to be an expression of the sultan's ambitions and achievements. One has to admit... it achieved the desired effect! Are you familiar with the Turkish series The Magnificent Century? If so, the figure of Suleiman the Magnificent is certainly not unfamiliar to you!  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size:35px;">Süleymaniye Mosque built on top of the third hill of historical Istanbul is one of the biggest mosques in the city.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center;">

  </div>
  <h2 style="margin-left: 120px;">Süleymaniye Mosque</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size: 25px;">The truly staggering size of the Süleymaniye Camii (Suleymaniye Mosque) is one of its most distinctive features – built by the legendary architect, Mimar Sinan, it is known as one of his masterpieces, and his largest design. It is not just the awe-inspiring size that is impressive (the central dome stands 47m high), but also the elegantly decorated interior.  The sense of space and light is emphasized in the supporting semi-domes to the northwest and southeast and the monumental arched spaces to the southwest and northeast.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center;">

  <p style="text-align: center;">Interior of Suleymaniye Mosque (Süleymaniye Camii) of Istanbul</p>
  <h2 style="margin-left: 120px;">Suleymaniye Mosque history</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size: 25px;">It took eight years to build and was completed in 1557, a tribute to Sultan Süleyman the Magnificent. The beautiful Suleymaniye Mosque is a fitting tribute to both the sultan and the architect. Suleyman was the longest-reigning sultan of the Ottoman Empire (1520-1566) and is regarded by some as a “Second Solomon” because of the harmony and justice under his rule. </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size: 30px;"> A troubled past</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size: 25px;">The history of the Suleymaniye Mosque hasn’t always been easy. It was ravaged by fire in 1660, and when it was restored by architect, Fossati (under the command of Sultan Mehmet IV) it was changed into a more baroque style, damaging the original design. During World War I, the courtyard was used as a weapons depot, which led to another fire when some of the munitions ignited. It wasn’t fully restored until 1956.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-left: 120px;">What else is there in the Suleymaniye Mosque complex?</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size: 25px;">Also in the Sülemaniye Külliyesi (mosque complex), there is a medrese (religious school), soup kitchen, hospital, caravanserai, library, bazaar and several tombs. Some of these facilities are still in use today. Notable are the tombs of Süleyman the Magnificent and his wife, Haseki Hürrem, (also known as Roxelana). Both are impressive; inlaid with precious metals, stones and stained glass. The tomb of the architect, Mimar Sinan, is also located here, in the north-western corner.</p>

  <h1 style="margin-left: 120px;">4. The most important landmarks of Istanbul - Topkapi Palace</h1>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size: 25px;">You probably already know that Istanbul's most important monuments are mainly palaces and mosques? One of them is precisely the Topkapi Palace, formerly inhabited by the Sultan himself and his court along with his harem. Construction of the palace began in 1453 at the request of Mehmed the Conqueror, and its first occupants moved in after just 12 years. The Topkapi Palace served as the residence of Turkish rulers for nearly 400 years and it is hard to believe that it still impresses us today with its grandeur and opulence!</p>

  <h2 style="margin-left: 120px;">Topkapi Palace Museum</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size: 25px;">Set on top of the most visible hill of Istanbul, Topkapi Palace, is the symbol of the city. Opulent, decadent, and steeped in history, it offers visitors a chance to get to know the Sultans of the Ottoman Empire rather more intimately.<br> It was built in 1461 by Mehmet the Conqueror and remained both the symbolic and political home of the Ottoman Empire until Sultan Abdülmecid I moved the imperial retinue to Dolmabahçe Palace in 1853. During the four centuries in between, it hosted 22 different Sultans and their families.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size: 25px;">It was converted into a museum after the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the creation of the Turkish Republic in 1924 and is a must-see for any tourist visiting Istanbul. It is made up of four different courtyards and various exhibitions such as the treasury, weapons, watch collection, kaftans, portraits, and sacred relics of prophets.</p>
  <h2 style="margin-left: 120px;">Amazing Facts about Topkapi Palace</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px; font-size: 25px;">The number of odalisques (concubines in the Imperial Harem) rose as the Ottoman Empire declined, numbering 809 during the reign of Abdülaziz (1861-76). They were often brought from Georgia or the Caucasus or captured in Hungary, Poland and Venice.<br>Some say that the fall of the Ottoman Empire was in part due to the madness that befell the unfortunate younger brothers of the Sultan who were imprisoned in The Cage (located within Harem section) to prevent wars of succession. When it was their turn to take the throne, several appeared to have become crazed by the many years of incarceration and were subsequently assassinated.<br>Topkapi museum is now the most visited museum in Istanbul, receiving nearly three million visitors annually. This means the queues can often be very large, particularly to see the Imperial Treasury and Room of the Relics of the Prophet.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 30px;">Shop in the labyrinthine streets of the Grand Bazaar</p>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">What can be said about the Grand Bazaar that hasn't been said before? As one of the oldest and largest covered markets in the world, Kapalı Çarşı, as it's known in Turkish, remains one of those crucial Istanbul experiences. Of course, not all of its more than 4000 shops are worthy of one's time, but getting lost in this shopping labyrinth, only to discover exactly what you're looking for, is pretty special nonetheless.<br><br>Some of the stand out shops include Punto Carpet (outside of Nuruosmaniye Gate), Dhoku, Recep Karaduman for kilims and carpets; Iznik Works for beautiful ceramic objects in the Iznik hand-painted style; Yazzma for traditional home textiles, ikat patterns; Cashmere House and Kaftan House for women's attires and Sevan Bıçakçı, Tina or Liebe for jewellery. </p>
  <p style="font-size: 30px;">A little-known Fact about the Grand Bazaar</p>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">A little-known fact about is that the Grand Bazaar used to be organized into sections specializing in one craft, each of which had its own han (caravanserai) where traveling merchants could rest and do business. These hans still exist today, some still dedicated to one craft, and the Zincirli Han is one of its fines, set around a lovely floor and workshops on the second.</p>
