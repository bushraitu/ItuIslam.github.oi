  <br>
  <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-left: 100px;">If it's all about location, Fethiye is one of the best places to visit in Turkey's Mediterranean region. This harbor-front town is the perfect launching pad to explore the many tourist attractions and things to do along the famed slice of lush coastline known as the Turquoise Coast.As well as being a major destination for boat day trips and the starting point for yacht multi-day tours, Fethiye is in a prime position to use as a base for days spent relaxing on the region's beaches or heading into the surrounding hills to explore the ruins of this area's ancient Lycian culture.Fethiye itself is a prosperous but laid-back kind of place; just what you need to return to after a day's hectic sightseeing of mighty rock-cut tombs and mountain-top, UNESCO-protected ruins or sunbathing bliss, boating, and paragliding action.</p>

    <h1>Fethiye Must-See Famous 7 Attractions</h1><br><br>
    <h1>1. Sunbathe then Paraglide Over Ölüdeniz Lagoon</h1><br>
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/TR/turkey-fethiye-panoramic-view-oludeniz.jpg">
    <p>Ölüdeniz Lagoon</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">Turkey's most famous beach is 15 kilometers south from Fethiye. The calm turquoise water, sheltered from the sea, with its white-sand beach rimmed by dense pine forest, is impossibly perfect, which is why people have been flocking here for years now.Some of Ölüdeniz's sheen has been shaken off over the past two decades, as package tourism arrived on the scene, but the lagoon area has not seen the construction development of other tourism hot spots, and the village attached to the lagoon is still a low-story unobtrusive affair.If you don't want to swim or sunbathe on the beach here, the other big activity is tandem paragliding.</p>
  <br>
  <div style="text-align: center;">

    <p>Paragliding over Oludeniz Lagoon</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">Mt. Baba (Baba Dağ) dominates the scenery inland, and paragliders launch themselves off the peak throughout the summer months.The aerial views of lush forested hills and turquoise blue water have made Ölüdeniz one of the most renowned tandem paragliding destinations in the world.The popular paragliding at Fethiye experience offers the typical Ölüdeniz tandem paragliding trip, with fully-qualified paragliding pilots and a choice of departure times from their Ölüdeniz office.</p>
  <br>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <h1>2. Explore the Ruins of Kayaköy</h1><br>
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2021/08/turkey-fethiye-top-attractions-explore-ruins-kayakoy-church.jpg">
    <p>One of Kayaköy's abandoned churches</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">Up until the 1920s, Kayaköy (ancient Karmylassos), eight kilometers south from Fethiye, had a thriving mixed population of Greeks and Turks who had lived together for centuries.The 1923 Population Exchange changed all of that, uprooting ethnic Greeks across Turkey and sending them to live in Greece while making ethnic Turks who lived in Greece abandon their lives there.The exchange created heartbreak and much trauma among those who were forced to leave, and the somber results of this are no better seen than in Kayaköy.</p>
  <br>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/TR/turkey-fethiye-ghost-village-kayakoy.jpg">
    <p>Kayaköy</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">The dilapidated, eerie stone village that snakes across the hillside here has been left to slowly decay since its Greek population left.Among the ruins are the Katapongagia Church and Taxiarchis Church, which both still have some beautiful interior decoration.</p><br>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <h1>3. Relax on the Beach of Butterfly Valley</h1><br>
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2021/08/turkey-fethiye-top-attractions-relax-beach-butterfly-valley.jpg">
    <p>Butterfly Valley</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">This lovely beach, secreted between two sharp cliffs, is home to the Jersey Tiger Butterfly.One of the joys of Butterfly Valley is that it is unreachable by road. You either have to trek here from Faralya village, high above on the cliff, or take a boat. During summer shuttle-boats depart for Butterfly Valley a couple of times daily from Ölüdeniz beach.There are great hiking opportunities in the lush, forested gorge behind the beach, though most people are happy to just spend the day soaking up the sun on the sand.</p>
  <br>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/TR/turkey-fethiye-butterfly-valley.jpg">
    <p>Butterfly Valley</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">The Butterfly Valley boat tour offers a full-day cruise from Ölüdeniz, visiting Butterfly Valley to relax or hike, as well as anchoring at other coves for swim stops. This is a great opportunity to take in the coastal views of the area. Lunch is included.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <h1>4. Hike through Saklikent Gorge</h1><br>
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/TR/turkey-fethiye-saklikent-gorge.jpg">
    <p>Saklikent Gorge</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">This ravine, 30 kilometers southeast from Fethiye, is cut deeply into the mountains of the Akdağlar mountain range. Most visitors come to admire the scenery of soaring cliffs on a hike inside the gorge.The trail into the gorge follows a wooden boardwalk along the cliffside, set high above the river. The last section of the trail is reached by fording the swift-running river itself and then walking through the narrow fissure to the waterfall at the end.Cushion-strewn teahouses are set beside the river, both at the entrance to the gorge and inside the gorge at the base where hikers ford the river.There are also canyoning and rafting trips along the river for the more actively inclined visitor.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <h1>5. Explore the Ruins of Xanthos</h1><br>
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2021/08/turkey-fethiye-top-attractions-explore-ruins-xanthos-theater.jpg">
    <p>Xanthos theater</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">Xanthos was the capital of ancient Lycia, sometimes called "the oldest republic in the world."This league of 20 cities was governed by a popular assembly and a president who ruled from Xanthos, and the ruins of this grand city are now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Although many of Xanthos' most beautiful monuments were taken to England in the 19th century, some fine mosaics are still in situ, and the theater, agora, and acropolis can still be seen.Beyond the Roman theater, to the left of the road, is the plinth that once held the Nereid Monument, an ionic temple with rich sculptural decoration (now displayed in the British Museum).To the right of the road is the Hellenistic city gage. The city walls, considerable stretches of which are still visible, probably date from the 3rd century BCE.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <h1>6. Day Trip to Turkey's Longest Beach at Patara</h1><br>
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/TR/turkey-fethiye-patara-beach-patara.jpg">
    <p>Patara</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">Patara (70 kilometers south from Fethiye) is home to Turkey's longest beach, so it's the perfect spot for a sun and sand break.This was also once an important city in the Lycian League, and the rambling ruins of Ancient Patara lay just behind the sand. Set off to explore them before cooling off in the sea.Ancient Patara's ruins are entered through a Roman-era triple-arched gate near a well-restored bouleuterion, a colonnaded street, theater, and baths complex, as well as plenty of tombs.The city was used right up to the Byzantine period, and a basilica can also be seen.Patara's other claim to fame is it's also the birthplace of Saint Nicholas of Myra (modern Demre, near Kaş), the 4th century bishop who became 'Santa Claus'.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <h1>7. Admire the Rock Tombs of Tlos</h1><br>
    <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/TR/turkey-fethiye-ruins-tlos.jpg">
    <p>Tlos</p>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">Perched high up amid the surrounding hill country, Tlos (35 kilometers east from Fethiye) is one of the Turquoise Coast's most interesting Lycian city ruins.Mostly known for its glut of Lycian rock tombs chiseled into the rock face of the acropolis hill, Tlos also has an agora, necropolis, baths, restored theater, a Byzantine basilica, and the scattered ruins of houses and public buildings to explore.The remnants of an Ottoman-era fortress also crown the acropolis hill showing that the Lycians weren't the only ones to appreciate a good mountain stronghold position. This fortress was used by various local brigands during Ottoman rule.</p>
